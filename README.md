Things to improve:
- 
- Spend less time overthinking
- Use different system besides Trigger volume, I realise that I can't attach trigger volume to moving object
  - Maybe use actor overlap with the elevator platform so I can enable UI while platform is moving
- actually implement the moving part of the elevator, i got stuck debugging trigger volume I botched the timing to implement lerping and implement it wrongly based on click

- Adding multiplayer shod be easy by making sure elevator object is replicated properly

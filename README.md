# Welcome to Khairul Azanni Test Project

Installation:
-
Clone project and git lfs pull

How to test:
-
press play and walk on to white platform press up button to call down elevator.

Feature:
- 
- trigger volume to enable Elevator UI

Result: 
-
Unable to complete the test due to time constriction.

Things to improve:
- 
- Spend less time overthinking
- Use different system besides Trigger volume, I realise that I can't attach trigger volume to moving object
  - Maybe use actor overlap with the elevator platform so I can enable UI while platform is moving
- actually implement the moving part of the elevator, i got stuck debugging trigger volume I botched the timing to implement lerping and implement it wrongly based on click
- Adding multiplayer shod be easy by making sure elevator object is replicated properly
